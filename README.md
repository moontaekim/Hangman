This game is an interpretation of hangman. The theme is Marvel super heros. There are 11 heros fighting against Thanos, the super villan that is trying to obtain all of the infiniti stones. Select a letter to guess which hero will be the one to take down Thanos once and for all. Be careful, you only have 6 lives!
